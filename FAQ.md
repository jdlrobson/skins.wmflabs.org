## How often does the preview get updated?

Every new MediaWiki release, I will pull the latest code for your skin. If your skin fatals I will disable it and file an issue against your skin. I will also update the entry on MediaWiki.org to mark it as **unstable**.

## My skin's preview got disabled! How do I restore it?

First make sure your skin is no longer fataling and the fixes are merged into master/main branch. Please also address any deprecation warnings before requesting an update.

Then please
